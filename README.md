# MMM-Unsplash
A <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror">MagicMirror²</a> module used to pull a random photo from one or more Unsplash collections. Like <a href="https://github.com/diego-vieira/MMM-RandomPhoto">MMM-RandomPhoto</a>, but for specific collections. Tested with MagicMirror² v2.2.2, v2.3.1 servers, Chrome 65 on Windows 10 and Midori 0.4.3 on a Raspberry Pi Zero W with Raspbian Jessie.

## Installation
1. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://github.com/parnic/MMM-Unsplash.git`.
2. Add the module inside `config.js` placing it where you prefer.
